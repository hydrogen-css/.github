Hydrogen is an open-source design and CSS utility framework powered by data-attributes.

By parsing the contents of custom data-h2- attributes, Hydrogen allows you to style elements completely from your markup. It comes equipped with a comprehensive library of tools and configurations for easy, seamless development. At runtime, it processes your markup and builds a CSS file that contains only the code you've used, preventing duplication and bloat.
